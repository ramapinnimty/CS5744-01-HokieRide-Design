There are three primary stakeholders associated with the HokieRide application: the riders,  drivers, and  Virginia Tech campus police department. Understanding their technical background and familiarity, along with what their expectations and preferences would be from this product is important in order to tailor the system design to meet their requirements to the best possible extent. 

## Riders

Those who are eligible riders of the application would be students and faculty of Virginia Tech, hence their technical knowledge to use a mobile application would be at a sufficient level for them to easily navigate through the app. As a rider, it is crucial that they are able to search and view all nearby available drivers along with the driver’s ratings. If they choose to accept a driver, they should have the ability to cancel, or should they choose to continue, they should be able to see a map with the driver’s real-time location as they approach the pickup spot and an estimated time of arrival. Riders should also indicate whether they are traveling solo or as a group to ensure that the driver is able to pick up all passengers in his/her car. Email and/or SMS notifications should be received to indicate the driver’s arrival and another should be sent out when the trip has been completed. Upon completion of the trip, the rider should be able to rate the driver. Additionally, due to unforeseen circumstances, if there occurs an accident or a threat to the rider’s safety, they should be able to quickly contact the campus police department for assistance.

## Drivers

Verified drivers are also going to be those who are students and faculty of Virginia Tech and therefore, would also be very comfortable with a smartphone and mobile applications. Drivers should be able to create a ride depending on the location that they are at and where they are going to, and should get requests as riders choose them. They should be able to choose the number of riders based on their car seat availability. If at full capacity or the driver chooses to not accept any more riders, he/she should be marked as unavailable to other riders searching for a ride. Additionally, based on the number of rides that drivers give to other Virginia Tech students and faculty, they should be able to see their credits accumulate and be used as either deposits into their Hokie Wallet or for free parking during school hours. Lastly, if there is any serious emergency, the driver should be able to notify the Virginia Tech campus police department for help.

## Virginia Tech Campus Police

Similar to the other stakeholders involved, the campus police department would be very familiar with technology of this degree, both with web and mobile-based applications. It is important that the campus police department is able to easily access data regarding students and faculty who are using the HokieRide app. Therefore, there should be options to search up information about a user's ride history and ride information by looking up their name or through HokieID. There should be sufficient information displayed about each user and their ride in the case of any emergency. This involves the user’s name, email, mobile phone number, HokieID and identification photo. Moreover, details about their past and current ride(s) should be visible with details regarding the start and end destination, current location, registered car model, and license plate. If the emergency alert button is clicked by any user, the web application will notify the department in a quick manner so action can be taken.The alert will contain details about the ride it is occurring on.
