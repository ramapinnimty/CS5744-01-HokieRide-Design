The HokieRide is a system that is dedicated to find rides when traveling short or long distances, especially during busy days when events take place (e.g game days, fests) or even late nights. This system will address safety by developing HokieRide, an application that includes a verification system for the drivers and riders as authenticated students or faculty of Virginia Tech. In addition, the system will be linked to the campus police department in the case of any emergencies.
Based on the requirements of the system, we have identified five core components: a non-relational cloud database, a relational cloud database, REST API, a web application and a mobile application. Implementing a layered architecture was an informed decision based on the requirements and use cases identified. It provides benefits regarding maintainability, modifiability, testability, and scalability which are some of the key attributes that help boost a system's software quality. Addressing these factors will be crucial for the success of the system and to expand the use of ridesharing app beyond Virginia Tech.
